# Passionfruit
**Spring Intensive Project**

## Project Purpose
Yelp for everyday makeup consumers. Discover new products through the point of view of an ordinary person, not a makeup artist.

## Built With
- Pyhton Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Jinja Templates

## How it Works
1. Users search for a product, brand, or browse through preset tags (eyes, lips face)
2. Users read reviews on a product
3. Users decide what to buy 

## Project Notes
**Personal Goals**
This is kind of like a playgound project, my goals were to learn how to use APis, implement a search bar, and continue exploring SQLAlchemy. 

**Goals for the future**
1. Add personalized information (skin color, eye color, skin type)
2. Add a user profile page
3. Add photos to reviews
